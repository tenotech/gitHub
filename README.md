## How to push

To push your project to GitHub, you can follow these general steps:

Create a GitHub repository: Go to GitHub's website and create a new repository. You can choose to create an empty repository or initialize it with a README file.

Initialize Git in your project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
```sh
git init
```
Add your project files to the repository: Use the following command to stage all the files in your project for commit:
```sh
git add .
```
Commit your changes: Commit the staged files with a descriptive commit message using the following command:
```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Add the remote repository: Connect your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. Run the following command, replacing <remote-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository:
```sh
git remote add origin <remote-url>
  ```
Push to GitHub: Push your local repository to GitHub using the following command:
```sh
git push -u origin master
 ```
If you're using a different branch, replace master with the name of your branch.

Enter your GitHub credentials: You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password (or a personal access token) to authenticate and push your code to the remote repository.
